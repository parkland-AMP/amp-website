		We are happy to accept proposals from students, faculty, and staff associated with Parkland College 
		and any not-for-profit organization in the Champaign-Urbana area. We are unable to work with for-
		profit businesses at this time.

		Preference is given to proposals that encourage students to think strategically. Projects that require 
		students to develop comprehensive promotional plans within 16 week semesters are ideal.
